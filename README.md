# MEDToolBox
## MEDToolBox is your medical toolbox for maxillofacial preoperative planning.

## Brief Introduction
###MEDToolBox is your medical toolbox for maxillofacial preoperative planning. My first impression of the software engineer. It means a milestone to me. This software is a preoperative planning system based on VTK&ITK. It includes many functions related to cranial and maxillofacial surgery. The use of the implicit function to make guide plane is an innovative function, which makes it possible to get any size and shape of the maxillofacial mesh.（图）

## Runtime Environment
###This software is based on VTK5.2 ITK4.4 and QT4.8(may you need QtDesigner too). You can cmake it yourself or download dll&lib from https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZprOfZXDY03wBqtpS3eUctlW8hNRc3rMNX for windows(VS2010) pcloud is a good choice~

## File Catalog
###MEDToolBox.rar include STLfiles(use for test),MEDToolBox(.sln .sdf files) and MEDToolBox folder(include almost all source code).

## Use&Warm Reminder
###For windows put the ITK VTK and QT folder the same catalog(open MEDToolBox.sln with txt you will know why). Rebuild it in the DEBUG&win32 mode.IN CASE you fail compile try to delete(1).suo .ncb .user(generated by VS2010). (2)debug or release catalog and some .obj files. (3)generatedfiles catalog(generated by QT). BUT I GUESS YOU WILL NOT MEET THAT.(图)
