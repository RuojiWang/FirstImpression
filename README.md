(1)My first impression of the software engineer. It means a milestone to me.
(2)This software is a preoperative planning system based on VTK&ITK. It includes many functions related to cranial and maxillofacial surgery.
(3)The use of the implicit function to make guide plane is an innovative function, which makes it possible to get any size and shape of the maxillofacial mesh.
(4)This software has all the files(including dll lib). Once you download it you can run with vs2010(win32&debug) and Qt4.8.
